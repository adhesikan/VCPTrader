You are updating an existing commercial web app called “VCP Trader”. Do NOT create a new repo.

GOAL
Remove any language that implies the Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP) was “developed by” or is owned/endorsed by any individual (e.g., Mark Minervini). Keep the educational guide page, but rewrite it to be neutral, descriptive, and compliance-safe.

SCOPE
Update the existing “VCP Strategy Guide” page (and any other pages/components where this wording appears).

REQUIREMENTS

1) REMOVE ATTRIBUTION / ENDORSEMENT LANGUAGE
Find and remove/replace any text like:
- “VCP was developed by legendary trader Mark Minervini…”
- “Minervini’s VCP strategy…”
- “created/invented by…”
- any wording implying affiliation, endorsement, sponsorship, or ownership

Do NOT mention Mark Minervini anywhere on the site unless it is in a clearly separated “Sources / Further Reading” section (not required for this task). For now, remove all mentions.

2) REWRITE “WHAT IS VCP?” SECTION (USE THIS TEXT)
Replace the “What is VCP?” description with the following exact copy:

TITLE:
“What is a Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP)?”

BODY:
“A volatility contraction pattern is a technical market structure where price ranges tighten as a stock consolidates near resistance. This behavior can reflect decreasing selling pressure while buyers remain active, and may precede a breakout when demand overwhelms supply.

VCP Trader identifies these contraction phases using objective price, volume, and moving-average data to help traders surface potential breakout conditions.”

3) KEEP THE REST OF THE CONTENT, BUT ENSURE NEUTRAL WORDING
- Keep your “Key Characteristics”, “Entry Strategy”, “Risk Management”, and “Pattern Stages” sections.
- Scan those sections for any “buy/sell” advisory phrasing and adjust to neutral language such as:
  - “potential breakout conditions”
  - “may indicate”
  - “informational/educational”
- Do not use: “guaranteed”, “recommended trade”, “buy now”, “sell now”.

4) ADD A SMALL DISCLAIMER ON THIS PAGE
At the bottom of the VCP Strategy Guide page (or top if you prefer), add this line:

“Educational & informational only. Not investment advice.”

5) OPTIONAL UI (IF PRESENT)
If the page has a “Learn about the VCP trading strategy” subtitle, change it to:

“Learn about volatility contraction setups and breakout conditions.”

6) GLOBAL SEARCH
Perform a global search across the repo for:
- “Minervini”
- “legendary trader”
- “developed by”
- “invented by”
- “creator of VCP”
and remove/replace with neutral language.

7) TEST / VERIFY
- Ensure the page renders properly after changes
- Ensure no mention of Mark Minervini remains
- Ensure the content reads naturally and looks consistent with the existing design

DELIVERABLE
Commit changes updating the VCP Strategy Guide and any other references so the app describes VCP as a general technical pattern without attribution or implied endorsement, and includes the educational disclaimer.
