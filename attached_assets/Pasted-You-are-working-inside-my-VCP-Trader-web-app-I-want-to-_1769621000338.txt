You are working inside my VCP Trader web app. I want to improve the LEFT NAV + PAGE HEADERS to make the UI cleaner and more user-friendly for new users, while keeping power-user features accessible. Also replace any “Performance Report” wording with “Trade Outcomes”.

IMPORTANT
- UI/UX changes only. Do NOT change backend logic, data fetching, scan algorithms, or trading logic.
- Keep existing routing intact (URLs should not change unless already easy/aliasable). Prefer changing labels/titles, not routes.
- Keep existing styling system (Tailwind/shadcn if used). Don’t add heavy new libraries.
- Must remain responsive and work on desktop + mobile.

OBJECTIVES
1) Simplify navigation by grouping items by user intent.
2) Reduce perceived complexity via collapsible sections + “Advanced” grouping.
3) Make each page clearer with consistent titles + 1-line helper text.
4) Add one-time onboarding guidance (“Start here”) without being annoying.
5) Replace “Performance Report” with “Trade Outcomes” everywhere in UI text.

NAVIGATION INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (IA)
Update the left nav to these groups/sections:

DISCOVER
- Opportunities (this is currently “Opportunity Engine” label, keep route the same)
- Breakout Alerts
- Watchlists

ANALYZE
- Charts
- Backtest
- Trade Outcomes (this replaces “Performance Report” or “Outcome Report” label; keep route the same)

EXECUTE
- Trade Execution (this is currently “Execution Cockpit” label; keep route the same)
- Alerts (execution/notifications)

LEARN
- How This Works (this is currently “Strategy Guide” label; keep route the same)
- Tutorials (only show if this page exists; otherwise omit)

SETTINGS
- Settings

NAV CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT

1) Rename intimidating items (label changes only)
- “Opportunity Engine” => “Opportunities” (route unchanged)
- “Execution Cockpit” => “Trade Execution” (route unchanged)
- “Strategy Guide” => “How This Works” (route unchanged)
- “Performance Report” => “Trade Outcomes” (route unchanged)
- If there is “Outcome Report” in UI, also rename to “Trade Outcomes”

2) Group items into collapsible sections
- Implement collapsible nav sections: Discover / Analyze / Execute / Learn / Settings
- Default behavior for NEW users:
  - Only “Discover” expanded, all others collapsed
- Store expand/collapse state in localStorage so returning users keep their preference.
- localStorage keys:
  - vcp_nav_section_discover
  - vcp_nav_section_analyze
  - vcp_nav_section_execute
  - vcp_nav_section_learn
  - vcp_nav_section_settings

3) Add “Start Here” indicator
- Add a subtle “Start here” / star indicator to “Opportunities” nav item for first-time users only.
- On hover or tooltip: “Start here to find live setups.”
- This indicator should disappear after the user clicks Opportunities once.
- Persist in localStorage:
  - vcp_start_here_seen = true after first click

4) Progressive disclosure for advanced tools
- Add an “Advanced” sub-section (or keep within Analyze but collapsed by default):
  - Backtest
  - Trade Outcomes
  - (Optionally) Trade Execution if you consider it advanced
- The goal: new users see fewer items immediately, but pros can access quickly.

5) Visual polish
- Ensure icons are consistent style (outline). If icons are mixed, normalize them.
- Slightly reduce sidebar width (e.g. from 280px to ~240px) unless it breaks layout.
- Improve spacing and alignment; reduce visual noise.
- Ensure active item highlight is clear.

6) Add a small status footer area in left nav (if relevant data exists)
- At bottom of sidebar show:
  - A small indicator “Live Scan” or “Market Hours” (static label is fine if no data)
  - Connection status if you already have it (e.g. “Broker Connected”)
- If you don’t have real status data, keep it simple and purely presentational.

PAGE-LEVEL CHANGES

7) Align page headers with nav labels
For each page, ensure:
- The page title matches the nav label (or a friendly expansion).
Examples:
- Nav: Opportunities -> Page title can be “Opportunity Engine” with a smaller label “Opportunities” OR just “Opportunities”
- Nav: Trade Outcomes -> Page title “Trade Outcomes”
- Nav: Trade Execution -> Page title “Trade Execution”
- Nav: How This Works -> Page title “How This Works”

8) Add a one-line helper text under each page title
Add a short descriptive line (NOT advisory) under the title. Examples:
- Opportunities: “Live breakout candidates from tight consolidations with volume expansion.”
- Breakout Alerts: “Real-time alerts when price and volume conditions trigger.”
- Watchlists: “Track names you care about and monitor setups.”
- Charts: “Review price action and levels for context.”
- Backtest: “Explore historical behavior of setups for research.”
- Trade Outcomes: “Summaries of executed trades and system activity.”
- Trade Execution: “Manage and monitor trade actions in one place.”
- Alerts: “Configure notifications and routing.”
- How This Works: “Learn the workflow and how to use the scanner.”

9) Reduce redundancy/confusion between pages
- Ensure “Breakout Alerts” vs “Alerts” are clearly distinct via helper text and page copy:
  - Breakout Alerts = discovery
  - Alerts = notifications/config

ONBOARDING (ONE-TIME) OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED

10) One-time mini coach banner on first visit to app (or first visit to Opportunities)
- Add a dismissible banner near top of main content:
  “New here? Start with Opportunities to see live setups. You can explore details before taking any action.”
- Add “Got it” button.
- Show only once; store:
  - vcp_coach_banner_dismissed

SEARCH & REPLACE REQUIREMENT

11) Replace “Performance Report” with “Trade Outcomes”
- Replace any UI string “Performance Report” with “Trade Outcomes”
- Replace “Outcome Report” label with “Trade Outcomes” as well (if present)
- Do not claim returns; avoid terms like “profit”, “returns”, “track record” in UI labels.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
- Locate the left sidebar nav component (e.g., Sidebar.tsx, Nav.tsx, Layout.tsx).
- Update the nav structure to grouped sections with collapsible behavior.
- Update page header components (e.g., PageHeader.tsx) or each page file to add helper text.
- Use localStorage helpers with safe guards for SSR (if Next.js): check typeof window !== 'undefined'
- Ensure mobile behavior: sidebar collapses/hamburger as currently implemented; do not break it.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Sidebar shows grouped, collapsible sections with fewer items visible by default for first-time users.
- “Opportunities” is clearly the starting point and highlighted for first-time users only.
- All occurrences of “Performance Report” and “Outcome Report” in UI become “Trade Outcomes”.
- Each page has a clear header + 1-line helper text.
- No route changes required; only labels/titles and UI components updated.
- Provide a summary of changes and list of files changed.

After implementation:
- Output a concise summary of what you changed
- List all files modified
- Mention any TODOs if you discover missing pages (e.g., Tutorials not present)
