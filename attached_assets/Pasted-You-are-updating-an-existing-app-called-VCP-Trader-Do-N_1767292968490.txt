You are updating an existing app called “VCP Trader”. Do NOT create a new repo.

GOAL
Add proper open-source licensing display and TradingView attribution for the **TradingView Lightweight Charts** library (Apache 2.0) so it is visible inside the app.

REQUIREMENTS

1) ADD A NEW PAGE: “Open Source Notices”
Create a new route/page:
- /open-source

Title: “Open Source Notices”
This page must be public (no login required) and must be linked from the footer and Settings → Legal.

2) ADD TRADINGVIEW LIGHTWEIGHT CHARTS ATTRIBUTION (REQUIRED TEXT)
On /open-source, add a section:

Heading: “TradingView Lightweight Charts”
Body (include exactly; do not paraphrase):
---
This product includes the TradingView Lightweight Charts library, which is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

---

3) INCLUDE THE FULL APACHE 2.0 LICENSE TEXT
On the same /open-source page, add a collapsible/accordion section labeled:
- “Apache License 2.0 (Full Text)”
Include the full license text in the app bundle.
Implementation details:
- Add a file in the repo: /legal/apache-2.0.txt (or similar)
- Load and render it on the page (client-side fetch or import as raw text)
- Ensure formatting is preserved (monospace block, pre-wrap)

4) FOOTER LINKS (GLOBAL)
Update the global footer to include:
- Terms
- Disclaimer
- Privacy
- Open Source
Where “Open Source” links to /open-source

5) SETTINGS → LEGAL (AUTHENTICATED)
If the app has a Settings page, add a “Legal” section with links:
- Terms of Use
- Disclaimer
- Privacy Policy
- Open Source Notices

6) OPTIONAL: “ABOUT” MODAL (IF IT EXISTS)
If the app has an “About” modal/page, add:
- “Open Source Notices” link
and a one-liner:
“Charts rendered using TradingView Lightweight Charts (Apache 2.0).”

7) DO NOT MISUSE TRADEMARKS
Ensure no marketing copy in the UI says:
- “Powered by TradingView”
- “TradingView Charts”
Instead only use:
- “Lightweight Charts library by TradingView (Apache 2.0)”
in the legal notices area.

8) QUALITY + TEST
- Keep styling consistent with existing UI (Tailwind)
- Add a small unit/integration test (if tests exist) that /open-source route renders and contains “TradingView Lightweight Charts” text.
- Ensure this works in production build.

DELIVERABLE
Implement /open-source page, add the attribution + license display, update footer and Settings → Legal links, and verify it’s visible in the running app.

Now implement these changes in the existing VCP Trader codebase.
