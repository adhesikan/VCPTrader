You are updating an existing app called “VCP Trader”. Do NOT create a new repo.

GOAL
Build a high-converting, compliance-safe marketing homepage at route “/” that clearly explains VCP Trader’s 3 subscription paths:
1) Scanner Only
2) Education Alerts Only
3) Pro (Scanner + Education Alerts)

The homepage must be mobile-first, fast, and visually modern, and must NOT use language that implies investment advice, guaranteed profits, or “buy/sell recommendations”.

TECH STACK (use existing)
- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Tailwind
- Use existing layout components, nav, and auth buttons if present
- Use lightweight-charts only for the app, NOT the marketing home (no heavy chart loads on landing page)

REQUIREMENTS

1) TOP NAV
- Left: VCP Trader logo + name
- Links: Features, How It Works, Pricing, FAQ, Legal
- Right: “Sign In” and primary CTA “Start Free Trial”
- Sticky on scroll

2) HERO SECTION
Headline (use exactly):
“Breakout Intelligence for Self-Directed Day Traders”

Buttons:
- Primary: “Start Free Trial”
- Secondary: “View Pricing”
Small note under buttons:
“Educational & informational only — not investment advice.”

3) TRUST / SOCIAL PROOF STRIP (no fake logos)

  - “Market-wide scanning”
  - “Real-time alerts (push + email)”
  - “Broker-connected data (optional)”
Do NOT add fake testimonials.

4) SECTION: “CHOOSE YOUR MODE”

“Educational examples only. Not personalized recommendations.”
CTA: “Get Education Alerts”

C) Pro
Title: “Pro”
Subtitle: “Scanner + Education Alerts together.”
Bullets:
- “Everything in Scanner + Education Alerts”
- “Compare your scans vs the model feed”

Step 2: “Identify VCP setups”
Step 3: “Get alerts and act on your plan”
Include a short note:
“You control the rules. You control the trades.”

7) SECTION: PRICING (simple, editable)
Show monthly pricing placeholders (do NOT hardcode if app has pricing config; otherwise use these defaults):
- Scanner: $79/mo
- Education Alerts: $59/mo
- Pro: $129/mo
Include:
- “Cancel anytime”
- “No guarantees. Past performance does not predict future results.”
Pricing CTAs should route to your existing checkout/pricing flow.

8) SECTION: FAQ
Include 6 FAQs (answers concise):

- Do NOT use: “buy/sell”, “trade recommendations”, “guaranteed”, “profit”, “make money”
- Use: “scan”, “detect”, “alert”, “educational”, “informational”, “self-directed”
- Do NOT show performance stats or backtest returns on the homepage.

11) ROUTING / AUTH
