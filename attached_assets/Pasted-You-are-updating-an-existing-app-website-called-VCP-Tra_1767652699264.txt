You are updating an existing app/website called “VCP Trader”. Do NOT create a new repo.

GOAL
1) Replace all existing tiered pricing with a SINGLE plan called “VCP Trader Pro”.
2) Add a time-sensitive promotional banner across the site: “Early Bird Access — 50% off until Jan 30, 2026”.
3) Ensure the promo is automatically hidden after Jan 30, 2026 (America/New_York).

WHERE TO UPDATE
- Homepage pricing section  
- /pricing page (if it exists)  
- Any plan comparison tables (remove them)  
- Checkout/Subscribe UI (if present) should only show VCP Trader Pro.

PROMO BANNER REQUIREMENTS
Banner text:
“Early Bird Access — 50% off VCP Trader Pro until Jan 30, 2026.”

Subtext:
“Lock in $59/mo (normally $129/mo). Cancel anytime.”

CTA button:
“Claim Early Bird”

CTA behavior:
- Scroll to pricing section or route to /pricing  
- If a checkout exists, pass a query param (?promo=EARLYBIRD50) so checkout can apply promo.

Automatic expiry:
- After Jan 30, 2026 11:59 PM America/New_York, the banner must not show.
- Use a single source of truth constant:
  PROMO_END_ISO="2026-01-31T04:59:59.999Z" (this equals Jan 30 11:59:59.999 PM ET)
- In UI logic: show banner only if Date.now() < PROMO_END_ISO.
- Also include a server-side check for promo eligibility to prevent client spoofing.

PROMO CODE / DISCOUNT LOGIC
If the app already uses Stripe:
- Create/expect a promo code “EARLYBIRD50” or coupon that applies 50% off recurring.
- In checkout, if query param promo=EARLYBIRD50 and now < promo end:
  apply discount
- If expired, ignore promo and show standard price.

If Stripe isn’t integrated yet:
- Still implement UI for promo display + passing query param + placeholder “Coming soon” on checkout.

UI/UX
- Banner should be sticky at the top but not cover nav (use a compact height).
- Add a small countdown text like: “Ends Jan 30, 2026” (no live ticking required).
- Use Tailwind and match existing design.
- Mobile friendly.

CONTENT UPDATES
Replace any old pricing copy with:
“One plan. Everything included.”

PRICING CARD LAYOUT
Create one clean pricing card that includes:
- Plan name  
- Promo badge “Early Bird 50% Off”  
- Promo price $59/mo  
- Strikethrough $129/mo  
- CTA “Start Free Trial” or “Subscribe”  
- Features list grouped as above  

TESTING
- Add a small unit test (if tests exist) that:
  - Banner is visible before promo end timestamp  
  - Banner is hidden after promo end timestamp  
  - Pricing page shows only one plan  

DELIVERABLE
Implement the single plan pricing across the site, add the promo banner with auto-expiry, wire the promo query param through to checkout if present, and ensure all pages reflect the new one-plan model.
