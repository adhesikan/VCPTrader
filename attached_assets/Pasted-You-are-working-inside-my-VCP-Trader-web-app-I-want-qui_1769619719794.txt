You are working inside my VCP Trader web app. I want quick UI/UX improvements to make the Opportunity Engine more enticing and less overwhelming to new users, while keeping the same data and functionality.

GOAL
- Reduce cognitive load for first-time users (less default info density).
- Add lightweight guidance + trust cues.
- Keep power-user details available via hover/expand (“progressive disclosure”).
- Do NOT change backend logic or the scan algorithm. UI-only changes.

SCOPE
- Only update the “Opportunity Engine” page and components it uses (Opportunity cards, scan header area, scan config section).
- Keep existing styling system (Tailwind/shadcn if used). Don’t introduce new heavy libraries unless already present.
- Must be responsive and not cluttered.

CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT

1) Add 1-line explainer above Active Opportunities
- Directly under “Opportunity Engine” title and subtitle, add a short explainer line:
  “Live breakout candidates from tight consolidations with volume expansion. Updates during market hours.”
- Style as muted text (smaller than subtitle).

2) Add a “Live / Auto-Updating” indicator near Last Scan
- Next to “Last Scan: …” add a small green dot + label “Live Scan”
- Tooltip: “Auto-updates during market hours. Click Scan Now to refresh instantly.”

3) Progressive disclosure on opportunity cards (reduce default density)
- Default card should show only:
  - Ticker
  - Strategy badge (e.g., BREAKOUT)
  - Score (rename from “Confidence %” to “Setup Strength”)
  - Current price + % move
  - Primary CTA button (InstaTrade™)
- Hide secondary metrics by default:
  - Resistance
  - Stop
  - Volume
  - RVOL
- Provide a “Details” affordance:
  - Option A (preferred): a small “Details” link or chevron on the card that expands/collapses a details panel.
  - Option B: show details only on hover on desktop, but ALWAYS accessible on mobile via expand toggle.
- Expanded details panel shows the hidden metrics exactly as before, with same values.

4) Rename “Confidence %” label + add tooltip for clarity
- Change label from “Confidence” to “Setup Strength”
- Tooltip content (short, compliant): “A score based on historical quality of similar setups. Not investment advice.”
- Keep the numeric value the same (e.g., 90%).

5) Add “Why this matters” micro-badge (non-advisory)
- On each card, show one small contextual badge under the main row (muted, optional):
  Choose from existing available fields (no new backend):
  - If RVOL >= 3: show “Volume expanding”
  - If % move is high (e.g., >= 5%): show “Momentum strong”
  - Else show “Tight setup”
- This must be purely descriptive and not a recommendation.
- If data missing, omit badge.

6) Feature ONE “Top Setup Right Now”
- In Active Opportunities list, pick the top opportunity using existing values:
  - Highest “Setup Strength” score
  - If tie, highest RVOL
- Add a small “Top Setup” pill on that card and slightly emphasize the card (subtle border/glow).
- Do not reorder the list unless already sorting exists; okay to reorder if simple and consistent.
- Keep it subtle (no flashing).

7) Improve visual hierarchy
- Reduce visual weight of secondary text and numbers.
- Make score/Setup Strength slightly more prominent.
- Keep colors consistent with current theme.

8) Make scan configuration feel optional
- The section currently labeled “Step 1 / Step 2” should become:
  - Title: “Customize Your Scan (Optional)”
  - Add small helper text: “Most users start with the default scan. Adjust anytime.”
- Collapse this section by default (accordion).
- Remember the collapsed state in localStorage so it stays collapsed for returning users.
- Keep existing controls/logic unchanged inside the accordion.

9) Add a first-time user coach mark (shows once)
- On first visit to Opportunity Engine ONLY, show a small dismissible helper banner above the cards:
  “New here? Click any card to preview the trade plan. Use InstaTrade™ when you’re ready.”
- Add “Got it” dismiss button.
- Store dismissal in localStorage so it shows only once.

10) Empty state improvements
- If there are 0 active opportunities, show an empty state card:
  Title: “No active breakouts right now”
  Text: “We’ll surface opportunities when volume expands from tight consolidations.”
  Secondary: “Try ‘Scan Now’ or adjust filters in Customize Your Scan.”
- Keep it in the same container so the page doesn’t look broken.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Identify the Opportunity Engine page component (likely under pages/ or app/ routes).
- Identify the OpportunityCard component (or create one if currently inline).
- Add a small Tooltip component if shadcn/ui already exists; otherwise implement a simple title attribute tooltip for speed.
- Add an Accordion for the optional scan section if already available; otherwise create a minimal collapsible panel using state + Tailwind.
- Use localStorage keys like:
  - vcp_opportunity_engine_coach_dismissed
  - vcp_scan_config_collapsed

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (must meet)
- On load, the page looks simpler: cards show fewer default metrics.
- Users can still access Resistance/Stop/Vol/RVOL via “Details” expand on every device.
- “Confidence” is now “Setup Strength” with tooltip.
- One card has “Top Setup” highlight.
- Scan config is collapsed by default and labeled optional.
- Coach mark shows only once and can be dismissed.
- Empty state is friendly and actionable.
- No backend changes, no breaking existing scan results.

After you implement, list the files changed and summarize what you did.
